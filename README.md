# Mementomori

Feel free to use this small and simple memento mori app!

## How to use
1. Host the website on your own or use mine at "https://mementomori.lukasweihrauch.de/"
2. Pass the requiret url parameters name, birthdate and lifespan

Here is a exmaple for Peter, who was born on the 02.05.1995. He tries to get 80 years old.
- name=Peter
- birthdate=02.05.1995
- lifespan=80

Connect all these to name=Peter&birthdate=02.05.1995&lifespan=80
Finaly attach it with the url of the website (here I use my domain)
https://mementomori.lukasweihrauch.de/?name=Peter&birthdate=02.05.1995&lifespan=80

Now the website should display you the correct data.
